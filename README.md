# Quantitative-Risk
Series of R scripts exhibiting quantitative approaches to modeling financial risks. Market, Credit, Operational

This repository contains selected examples of R scripts I have previously written demonstrating my experience with quantitative risk modeling for finance.
Within are examples pertaining to different approaches to modeling different kinds of financial risk for different financial instruments, particularly equity portfolios and fixed income instruments. Each script contains commentary that I hope the reader finds insightful towards understanding the goals of the script.
